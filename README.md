# Super-Mario-Bros
A mini Super Mario Bros-style game developed in C using CVI, featuring keyboard controls, animated sprites, moving backgrounds, coin collection, and enemy avoidance. The game is time-based with limited lives, combining basic game logic, image rendering, and user interactionâ€”my first coding project integrating graphics and gameplay mechanics.
